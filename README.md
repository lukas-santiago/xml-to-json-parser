# Simple XML to JSON Parser

This simple java application is to parse a XML file to JSON file.

To use this application you need to pass a file path on argument.

Example `java src/App.java input.txt` (replace `input.txt` with your file path)
The output file will be filled on `./output.json`

This is an exercise for FTT in the Compiler subject of the Computer Engineering course
